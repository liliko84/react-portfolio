        <p> I have 7 years of work experience back in my Country:
              My first Job was as an Operator in Internet Provider Company "Georgia Online", which was very hard at the
              beggining because had no idea about computers, but then got used to it and learned lots of interesting
              things.
              Then I was manager in Mobile Content Provider "Geoline", which was also very fun and interesting.
              The last Company that I was working was Aviation Fuel Supply Company "Georgian Petroleum" where I was
              Assistant
              of the General director.</p>
